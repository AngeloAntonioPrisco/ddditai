At the moment, I am the only contributor to this project.  
I am a student at **University of Salerno (UNISA)**, currently enrolled in the Master's program in **Software Engineering**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

**Dddit AI** is a Python-based system that automatically tags **FBX 3D models** pushed to the **Dddit Server**.  
Its goal is to help 3D artists organize and understand assets, improving workflow efficiency.

**Key Use Cases:**  
- Automatic tagging of 3D models (`character`, `environment`, `prop`, `weapon`, etc.)  
- Track changes between model versions  
- Maintain consistency in large repositories of assets  

**Target Users:**  
- 3D artists specializing in architecture, props, environment, characters, weapons, etc.

## ðŸ§© Features

- Integration with Dddit Serverâ€™s push workflow  
- Assigns tags such as model complexity (`lowpoly`, `highpoly`), type (`prop`, `character`, `environment`), and style (`realistic-style`, `stylized`)  
- MLflow tracking for datasets, experiments, and model versions  
- Models exported in **ONNX** format for lightweight inference  
- Conditional deployment based on monitored performance metrics
- Automatic model reload on Dddit Server. 

## ðŸš€ How to try it

The entire project can be executed locally using **PyCharm**.

### Run locally
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AngeloAntonioPrisco/ddditai.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Pycharm.

3. Edit the Run/Debug configuration to load environment variables from a custom *.env* file, like:
    ```bash
    SKETCHFAB_TOKEN_1="sketchfab-token-1"
    SKETCHFAB_TOKEN_2="sketchfab-token-2"
    SKETCHFAB_TOKEN_3="sketchfab-token-3"
    SKETCHFAB_TOKEN_4="sketchfab-token-4"

    MLFLOW_ARTIFACT_URI="ml-flow-artifact-uri"
    MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="ml-flow-tracking-uri

    AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="azure-storage-account-name"
    AZURE_STORAGE_KEY="azure-storage-key"
    AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="azure-storage-connection-string"
    ```
4. Create a folder named `MLflow` in `AppData\Local` folder.

5. Create in `MLflow` folder a folder named `mlruns` and one named `artifacts`.

6. Open `CMD` and type:
    ```bash
    "path-to-project\.venv\Scripts\activate"
    ```

7. In the same `CMD` type:

    ```bash
    mlflow server --backend-store-uri file:///~/AppData/Local/MLflow/mlruns --default-artifact-root file:///~/AppData/Local/MLflow/artifacts --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
    ```
7. Start the application from PyCharm.
