## 1. Initial Strategy

**Section Description:**  
This section describes the initial plan for collecting and understanding the data. It represents the intended strategy before actual data retrieval, including what features were expected to be available, the sources, and the methodology.

**Objective:**  
Automatically collect an initial dataset of 500 FBX models from Sketchfab, extracting all relevant metadata and user-defined tags for exploratory analysis and model training.

**Planned Data Sources:**  
- Sketchfab API v3 (`/v3/models` and `/v3/models/{uid}`)  
- Retrieval automated (no manual UID insertion)  
- Multithreading to speed up collection  

**Metadata to Extract:**  

| Feature                 | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| triangles               | Number of triangles in the mesh (measure of model complexity)               |
| vertices                | Number of vertices in the mesh                                              |
| materials               | Number of materials used in the model                                       |
| textures                | Number of textures applied                                                  |
| UV layers               | Presence and number of UV mapping layers                                     |
| vertex colors           | Whether the model contains vertex color information                         |
| animations              | Number of animations present in the model                                    |
| rigged geometries       | Whether the model is rigged for animation                                    |
| morph geometries        | Number of morph targets for shape changes                                    |
| scale transformations   | Whether the model has applied scale transformations                          |
| user tags               | Tags provided by the model creator                                           |
| user categories         | Category selected by the user (e.g., prop, character, environment, weapon)  |

**Note:**  
It was decided **not** to download the FBX models due to time and computational restrictions. Downloading models would require significantly more processing time and RAM. Instead, the system relies solely on metadata accessible via the API, which allows fast multithreaded retrieval.

**Storage Plan:**  
- Data to be logged and versioned in MLflow  
- Exportable to CSV for offline analysis
